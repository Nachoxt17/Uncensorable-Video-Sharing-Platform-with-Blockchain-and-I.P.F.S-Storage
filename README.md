## Uncensorable-Video-Sharing-Platform-with-Blockchain-and-I.P.F.S-Storage

+-Uncensorable Video Sharing Platform(made as a Youtube Clone but without Censorship) made with Blockchain and I.P.F.S storage using Ethereum, Javascript, Solidity, Web3.js and React.js.

+-Users can connect their Cryptocurrencies Wallet to the Website which will also connect to the Blockchain where all the Website Code(Smart Contracts) and Data will be stored, except for the Videos; in this case the Smart Contracts will store references(the Video Hash) to the Videos on the Platform which will be stored in the InterPlanetary File System.
